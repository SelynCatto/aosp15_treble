Subject: [PATCH 08/11] gd: hci: Ignore command READ_REMOTE_VERSION_INFORMATION
 result if it doesn't in command_queue_

In MTK Dimensity 8100 devices, com.android.bluetooth will gets crash if try to connect a new device.

F DEBUG   : Abort message: 'assertion 'op_code == OpCode::NONE' failed - Received COMMAND_STATUS event with OpCode 0x41d (READ_REMOTE_VERSION_INFORMATION) without a waiting command(is the HAL sending commands, but not handling the events?)'

It means this command isn't in the command_queue_, we can just ignore it.
